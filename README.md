## Learning Go 

I have been learning Go for a while now and I am really enjoying it. I have been using Go to build REST APIs and CLI tools. I am also learning about Go's concurrency model and how to write concurrent programs.

Created a basic random weather API using Go and Gin. The API is live at https://bilwani-weather-api.fly.dev/

### Building a REST API with Go Gin

#### 1. Install Go

```bash
brew install go
```

#### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

#### 4. Run the server

```bash
go run main.go
```

#### 5. Build the server

```bash
go build
```
